# Agent Implementation Plan

## Goal

To design a flexible agent system that can be configured with a role, tools, and structured output requirements.

## Framework

Langchain.js will be used as the client-side framework for implementing the agent. Langchain.js is an open-source framework, so there is no direct cost to use it. However, there may be costs associated with the LLM services that Langchain.js interacts with.

## Design and Architecture

*   Create a class or module for the agent, which will handle the agent's role, tools, and output formatting.
*   Implement a mechanism for assigning tools to the agent based on its role.
*   Define a structured output format using JSON schema or similar.
*   Integrate the agent with the LLM service to enable it to interact with the LLM.
*   Implement a feedback loop to allow the agent to learn and improve over time.

## Implementation

*   Create the agent class/module with the necessary methods for tool management and output formatting.
*   Implement the tool assignment mechanism.
*   Define the structured output format.
*   Integrate the agent with the LLM service.
*   Implement the feedback loop.

## Testing

*   Create unit tests to verify the agent's functionality.
*   Create integration tests to verify the agent's integration with the LLM service.
*   Test the agent with different roles, tools, and output formats.

## Deployment

*   Deploy the agent to a suitable environment.
*   Monitor the agent's performance and make adjustments as needed.
